# Bazaar Bot

- Repository for my WIP discord bot which interacts with the Hypixel API.
- Please ignore my terrible code lol

- After the nerf to sniping bazaar insta-sells this bot is kinda useless but I'll leave it here because it could be useful.


## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your .env file

`TOKEN`




## Installation

- Install disnake and python-dotenv using pip:
```bash
  pip3 install disnake
  pip3 install python-dotenv
```
- Download the files from github and unzip them
- Paste your token into a .env file in the same directory:
```
TOKEN=[your token here]
```

- Navigate to the folder and run using python 3 (you can use nohup to run it in the background).

```bash
  cd [route to discord bot]
  python3 bazaar_bot.py
  (or) nohup python3 bazaar_bot.py &
```
